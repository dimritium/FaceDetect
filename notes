Use the function cv2.imread() to read an image. The image should be in the working directory or a full path of image
should be given.
Second argument is a flag which specifies the way image should be read.
• cv2.IMREAD_COLOR : Loads a color image. Any transparency of image will be neglected. It is the default
flag.
• cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE : Loads image in grayscale mode
• cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED : Loads image as such including alpha channel
Note: Instead of these three flags, you can simply pass integers 1, 0 or -1 respectively.
